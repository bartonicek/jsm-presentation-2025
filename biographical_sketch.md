Adam is a doctoral candidate in statistics at The University of Auckland, New Zealand.
His journey into statistics and data science began as an applied researcher in psychology, 
where he analyzed survey data and tried to teach pigeons how to play tic-tac-toe. 
Ultimately, he discovered his true passion lay in the field of statistics. 
Currently, his research centers on interactive data visualization, 
particularly the interplay between user interaction and the algebraic properties of plots.
Beyond data visualization, Adam is also passionate about programming 
(primarily R and JavaScript), Bayesian statistics, and surfing.
